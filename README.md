```
git clone git@github.com:BilalZaib/AutoGrader.git
cd AutoGrader/

## Getting into system?
1. After the installation admin user will logon to the system.

3. After the creation of Instructor, instructor will logon to his account.
4. Instructor will create Assignment and share enroll key with students.
5. Student will register to the system from [http://127.0.0.1:8000/autograder](http://127.0.0.1:8000/autograder)
6. Student will logon to the system and enter the enroll key to enroll into the course.

Instructor uploads three files with Assignment which is `assignment_file`, `instructor_test_file` and `student_test_file`. Student will have to write code in `assignment_file` and 
it will be tested against `student_test_file` for student and after the submission to server the `assignment_file` will be tested againts `instructor_test_file` and submission will be stored with score in the database.
